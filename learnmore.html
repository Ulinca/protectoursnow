      The Arctic and Antarctic are the world’s refrigerator. Since they are covered in white snow and ice that reflect heat back into space, they balance out other parts of the world that absorb heat. Less ice means less reflected heat, meaning more intense heatwaves worldwide. But it also means more extreme winters: as the polar jet stream—a high-pressure wind that circles the Arctic region—is destabilized by warmer air, it can dip south, bringing bitter cold with it.

      "(It) is a pure physical testimony to how gnarly climate change is," snowboarder Jamie Anderson said at Team USA's media summit in October.The two-time Olympic gold medalist said she noticed chunks of ice breaking off a glacier at Saas-Fee, and trickling waterfalls where ice was once frozen solid. Ryan Cochran-Siegle, a veteran Alpine skier, said he's seen "significant changes" since he first started training in Europe years ago. Para snowboarder Keith Gabel called it "mind-boggling."

      "Who's to know how much longer we'll be able to compete in Alpine skiing?" added para Alpine skier Thomas Walsh. "... Not to be pessimistic about it, but there's the question of how long we'll be able to do this, and how long we'll be able to ski outside on real snow."

      When there’s less sea ice, animals that depend on it for survival must adapt or perish. Loss of ice and melting permafrost spells trouble for polar bears, walruses, arctic foxes, snowy owls, reindeer, and many other species. As they are affected, so too are the other species that depend on them, in addition to people. Wildlife and people are coming into more frequent contact – and often conflict – as wildlife encroach on Arctic communities, looking for refuge as their sea ice habitat disappears.

      The polar bear’s emaciated body looked more like “a rug” than one of the world’s most powerful predators.For all its hunting prowess, the giant animal appears to have starved to death as it made a desperate journey north on the Arctic island of Svalbard in search of seals.
       <p class="lead">
      Experts fear polar bears will increasingly suffer a similar fate as global warming melts the sea ice that allows them to hunt for their main source of food.

      Food security — the reliable access to safe, affordable, and nutritious food — is inextricably linked to a predictable climate and healthy ecosystems. Climate change and associated severe weather, droughts, fires, pests, and diseases are already threatening the production of food around the world. Unless we act decisively, these problems will worsen, the poorest and most vulnerable will suffer disproportionately, and instability will increase.
       </p>
        <p class="lead">
      Polar vortexes, increased heat waves, and unpredictability of weather caused by ice loss are already causing significant damage to crops on which global food systems depend. This instability will continue to mean higher prices for you and growing crises for the world’s most vulnerable.
       </p>
       <p class="lead">
      Yield growth for wheat, maize, and other crops has been declining in many countries due to extreme heat, severe weather, and droughts. By some estimates, in the absence of effective adaptation, global yields could decline by up to 30 percent by 2050. Countries that are already grappling with conflict, pollution, deforestation, and other challenges are likely to suffer the brunt of these impacts. The 2 billion people already without access to sufficient food, including smallholder farmers and other people living in poverty, will be hit hardest.
